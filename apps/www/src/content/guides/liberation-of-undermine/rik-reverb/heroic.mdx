A step up from the previous two fights, Rik Reverb is a fight about draining the power of amplifier pylons with adds, sonic rings, frontals, beams, and all of the other things that people find annoying. This fight was considerably bugged on the PTR and has some unanswered questions about how some of the mechanics work.

## Mechanics

### Phase One

<Mechanic id="473748" difficulty="heroic" name="Amplification!" caption="JBL Speakers">

Rik spawns spawns an [Amplifier][amplifier] underneath him, dealing 5 million damage to anyone in the impact area, knocking them away and stunning them for 3 seconds. The second and third time this ability is cast he also spawns one underneath a ranged player.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="466128" difficulty="heroic" name="Resonance" caption="Keep Boss Away from Amplifiers">

Rik significantly booses the power geneation of amplifiers within 15 yards of him.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="464488" difficulty="heroic" name="Sonic Blast" caption="Melee Frontals" pill={[<MechanicPill key="1" variant="blue">Tank</MechanicPill>]}>

Rik's melee attacks deal 1.5 million sonic damage in a 9 yard frontal cone and apply [Tinnitus][tinnitus], which applies a stacking 100% [vulnerability][tinnitus] to sonic damage (everything on the fight) for 10 seconds.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="467606" difficulty="heroic" name="Sound Cannon" caption="Fixated Frontal">

Rik tracks a random player before dealing large damage to anyone in the line of fire. The targeted player cannot dodge the frontal.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="466961" difficulty="heroic" name="Faulty Zap" caption="Spread Circles">

Rik jolts several players for 755k nature damage and applying a dot that deals 503k nature damage to everyone within 5 yards every 1.5 sec for 12 sec, additionally, the player takes 75% increased nature damage while affected.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="472306" difficulty="heroic" name="Sparkblast Ignition" caption="Firework Adds!" pill={[<MechanicPill key="1" variant="red">Important</MechanicPill>]}>
 
Rik summons several [Pyrotechnics](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=232612/pyrotechnics) firework bundles, dealing 3.1 million fire damage to anyone in their landing area and rain down fire circles that deal the same amount to anyone hit.

- The pyrotechnics have a 15 second timer, after which they [explode][grand-finale], applying a stacking dot dealing 5.9 million fire every 1 sec for 15 secs to the raid.
- Attacking pyrotechnics gives players [Excitement][excitement], increasing movement speed by 10% and haste by 2% for 10 seconds, stacking 3 times.

</Mechanic>
#### Amplifiers

<Mechanic id="1217120" difficulty="heroic" name="Lingering Voltage" caption="Draining the Amplifier">

Players can interact with amplifiers to channel and their energy, dealing 565,831 nature damage to them every 1 sec. Anyone can drain an amplifier at any time, but on heroic draining applies a 50% vulnerability to successive drains for 45 seconds, stacking.

It's my (limited) understanding that you will continue to drain an amplifier until it runs out of energy, or you run away and snap the tether it places on you. You should be able to cast while draining an amplifier.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="465795" difficulty="heroic" name="Noise Pollution" caption="Rot Damage">

The amplifiers do 377k sonic damage every 2 seconds to all players,increased by 25% for each active amplifier.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="468119" difficulty="heroic" name="Resonant Echoes" caption="Sonic Rings">

The amplifiers shoot out a series of sonic waves that deal 503k sonic damage every 0.5 sec for 6 sec, stacking.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="466093" difficulty="heroic" name="Haywire" caption="Full-Energy Enrage">

An amplifier that has full energy goes haywire, dealing 503k sonic damage to all players every 1 sec and expelling additional [Resonant Echoes][resonant-echoes].

</Mechanic>


### Intermission

At 100 energy Rik shields himself with [Sound Cloud][sound-cloud] ðŸ™„, taking 99% reduced damage and overloads his amplifiers with country music. He will cast [Blaring Drop][blaring-drop] and [Blowout][blowout] 4 times, destroying 4 of the 5 amplifiers each round, with the extra amplifier carrying over to the next phase. If he reaches the intermission for a 3rd time he casts [Hype Fever][hype-fever], enraging.

<Mechanic id="467991" difficulty="heroic" name="Blaring Drop" caption="Sonic Wave">

A ring of country music radiates outwards from Rik, dealing 3.1 million sonic damage every 0.5 sec for 3 sec to anyone hit.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="466722" difficulty="heroic" name="Blowout" caption="Fangirling Amplifiers">

Rik overloads an amplifier, indicated by a blue ring around it. Standing in the ring while [Blaring Drop][blaring-drop] hits the amplifier causes it to explode, knocking players back and granting immunity to the ring.

  <Callout type="warning">
    This knockback originates from the amplifier in all directions. You will want to place yourself in line with the exploding amplifier and the next highest energy one, or at least towards the ring.
  </Callout>

</Mechanic>

## Strategy

The following strategy is adapted from a theoretical mythic strategy theory by Reloe, as this is a noticably more annoying fight than the previous two so there is merit to one. The goal is to optimize ranged having to move as little as possible despite us constantly needing to drain the amplifiers. It's reasonable for us to yolo this boss in heroic, or fail at something like below to the point it's essentially yoloing the fight, but I'm describing the thought process so you understand how to think about the fight.

    A ring of arbitrary markers are placed in a circle around the room. The tanks will bring the boss to <Square /> on pull, and the boss will drop a single amplifier underneath him. Ranged will hang around <Triangle />.

    The boss will then be moved to <Diamond /> until he drops the second amplifier. When this happens ranged will spawn the third amplifier underneath them at <Triangle />.

    As melee are chilling on <Diamond /> until the second amplifier spawns, they will need to peel off and occasionally drain the amplifier at <Square />. We only need two melee assigned to alternate soaking the amplifier at this location for the duration of the fight.

  <TabsContent value="p3">
    ![](#assets/images/guides/liberation-of-undermine/rik-reverb/heroic/raidplan_p3.png)

    The boss is moved to the middle after the second round of amplifiers spawn and ranged will shift counter-clockwise to <Star />. A pair of melee will now be responsible for keeping the amplifier at <Diamond /> drained, and a pair of ranged will be responsible for the <Triangle /> amplifier.

    Ranged will remain at <Star /> until they spawn the fourth amplifier, but the tanks will need to move the boss to <Circle /> in time for the fifth to spawn there. The amplifiers spawn 40 seconds apart, so the tanks should leave the boss in the middle of the room for about 30 seconds.

  <TabsContent value="p4">
    ![](#assets/images/guides/liberation-of-undermine/rik-reverb/heroic/raidplan_p4.png)

    In the intermission the boss puts out his [Sound Cloud][sound-cloud] remix, causing the highest energy amplifier to fangirl and rapidly bring itself to [Haywire][haywire] and exploding from [Blowout][blowout], letting us avoid the [Blaring Drop][blaring-drop]. This repeats four times and then the intermission ends. This means an amplifier will carry over to the next phase 1, for 6 total, then 7, then the last intermission he enrages.
    
    The amplifiers have been modified throughout the PTR, and the latest information I have is that the amplifiers that aren't fangirling lose energy during the intermission to the point where it's random which amplifier explodes 3rd and 4th.
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="p5">
    ![](#assets/images/guides/liberation-of-undermine/rik-reverb/heroic/raidplan_p5.png)
    
    The second time we reach phase 3, assuming the random amplifier issue continues onto live servers, the solution is simple â€” we start counter-clockwise of wherever the remaining amplifier is. The movements are all the same, just with a different starting position. This allows ranged to still only move between 2 adjacent markers.
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="p6">

    The third and final time we enter phase 1 we will have 2 extra amplifiers. This might seem confusing but we always want to start counter-clockwise, or to the left if we're in the middle of the room facing the markers, of the amplifier that gives us the most space.

    - If the remaining amplifiers have less than 2 markers between them, we can repeat what we did the second time we got to phase 1, starting to the left of an amplifier such that we have 5 contiguous markers to work with.
    - If the remaining amplifiers have 2 markers between them, we still want to start to the left (from the inside looking out; counter-clockwise) of the amplifier that gives us the most free markers. This still allows ranged to only need to move between 2 markers. The melee will have to skip over an amplifier on the last set.

      ![](#assets/images/guides/liberation-of-undermine/rik-reverb/heroic/raidplan_p7.png)
    
    - If the remaining amplifiers are equidistent from each other, aka they have 3 markers between them, the placement decision is arbitrary and ranged will need to jump a marker after the second set.
