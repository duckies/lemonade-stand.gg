In these mean streets, there has never been a rivalry more sinister and diarrhea inducing than the, obvious, fued between the homosexual mecha-fire-t-rexes and a gorilla that has mastered the art of lightning wizardry.

## Mechanics

### Shared

<Mechanic id="471660" difficulty="heroic" name="Raised Guard" caption="The Bosses Can't Kiss">

If the bosses are within 40 yards of each other they take 99% reduced damage. This doesn't occur during [Colossal Clash][colossal-clash].

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="465833" difficulty="heroic" name="Colossal Clash" caption="They Kiss Anyway!">

At 100 energy, Flarendo and Torq *kiss* in the middle of the arena for 20 seconds. The raid takes 188k fire and nature damage every second, increasing by 25% every time they clash. As this happens, [Zapbolt][zapbolt] circles and [Fiery Waves][fiery-wave] spawn around the arena.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="471557" difficulty="heroic" name="King of Carnage" caption="There Can('t) Only Be One">

The bosses do not share health, and if one of them dies the other gained 50% increased damage every 5 seconds and "vastly increasing the range of some abilities."

</Mechanic>

### ðŸ’… Flarendo the Fabulous, er, Furious

<Mechanic id="472220" difficulty="heroic" name="Blistering Spite" caption="Stacking Flarendo Debuff">

Players within 60 yards of Flarendo gain a stacking debuff every 5 seconds that deals 12.5k damage every 1 sec for 15 sec.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="473650" difficulty="heroic" name="Scrapbomb" caption="Baited Soak Bombs">

Flarendo coughs up a bomb that deals 4.4 million fire damage to the entire raid, reduced for each soaking player. The players soaking are knocked away when it goes off.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="1214039" difficulty="heroic" name="Molten Pool" caption="Bomb Miasma" pill={[<MechanicPill key="1">Heroic</MechanicPill>]}>

Exploded [Scrapbombs][scrapbomb] leave behind a pool of molten metal, dealing 1.2 million fire damage per second to players touching it and sending out [Fiery Waves][fiery-wave] when it spawns.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="1213688" difficulty="heroic" name="Molten Phlegm" caption="Spread Circles" pill={[<MechanicPill key="1">Heroic</MechanicPill>, <MechanicPill key="2" variant="green">Healers</MechanicPill>]}>

Flarendo coats players in molten snot, dealing 566k fire damage to everyone within 5 yards of the player every 1 sec for 10 sec.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="472231" difficulty="heroic" name="Blastburn Roarcannon" caption="Semi-Fixated Beam" pill={[<MechanicPill key="1" variant="red">Danger, Will Robinson</MechanicPill>]}>

<Image className="rounded-lg float-right ml-3 mb-3" alt="falling down stairs" src="/images/misc/falling-stairs.gif" width="180" height="180" unoptimized /> Flarendo fixates on a player for 3 sec, then charges a beam that deals 50 million fire damage every 0.1 sec over 2 sec, before firing for 3 sec.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="1214190" difficulty="heroic" name="Eruption Stomp" caption="Tank, Smooshed"
pill={[<MechanicPill key="1" variant="blue">Tanks</MechanicPill>]}
>

Flarendo runs *several* calculations over 4 seconds before stomping their current target dealing 12.5 million fire damage, launching them into the air and releasing [Fiery Waves][fiery-wave] in all directions.

</Mechanic>

### Torq the Tempest

<Mechanic id="472223" difficulty="heroic" name="Galvanized Spite" caption="Stacking Torq Debuff">

Players within 60 yards of Torq gain a stacking debuff every 5 seconds that deals 12.5k damage every 1 sec for 15 sec.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="473951" difficulty="heroic" name="Static Charge" caption="Carpet Static Shocks">

Players within range of Torq take 94k nature damage every 1 sec and build a charge while they continue to move which drains when stationary. A player is [stunned][static-charge] for 6 seconds if they fill their charge bar completely.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="463840" difficulty="heroic" name="Thunderdrum Salvo" caption="Lightning Bombardment">

Torq launches multiple missles at all players within 60 yards for 6 seconds as swirls that players must stutter-step to avoid. They deal 3.1 million nature damage on impact.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="1213994" difficulty="heroic" name="Voltaic Image" caption="Spiritual Gorillas"  pill={[<MechanicPill key="1">Heroic</MechanicPill>]}>

An image of Flarendo fixates a player for 12 seconds that explodes on contact with their target, dealing 3.4 million nature damage to players within 10 yards and leaving behind [Lingering Electricity][lingering-electricity].

Lingering Electricity is lightning miasma that deals 944k nature damage every 1 sec to players within the area, silencing and pacifying them.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="466178" difficulty="heroic" name="Lightning Bash" caption="Tank, Booshed">

Torq slaps his current target, inflicting 15.7 million physical damage, and hitting again for 100% of any unmitigated damage as nature damage.

</Mechanic>

## Strategy

![](#assets/images/guides/liberation-of-undermine/cauldron-of-carnage/heroic/raidplan_p1.png)


### Flarendo Side
The Flarendo side has diminishing space because of the [Molten Pools][molten-pool] left behind by [Scrapbomb][scrapbomb] with three other considerations:

1. The more people soaking the bomb the better. Everyone, including the playes fighting Torq, will take damage reduced by the number of people soaking. This negates any strategies of this being a tank-only, or immuneable mechanic.
2. The bombs are baited on any non-tank player within melee range of Flarendo.
3. Immediately following each bomb explosion are the spread debuffs, [Molten Phlegm][molten-phlegm]. These debuffs last until right *after* the next bomb spawns, preventing the group from stacking to bait the bombs after the first one.

On pull the Flarendo tank will take the boss closer to the wall at the bottom of the arena and the raid will stack on them to bait the bomb, soak it, then spread out for [Molten Phlegm][molten-phlegm]. This is arbitrary, just be near a wall.

The boss can then be moved away from the pool slightly. The pool will fire [Fiery Waves][fiery-wave] when it spawns but nothing afterwards, so moving the boss is more a natural consequence of the bomb knockback and giving melee room around the boss while staying spreading out than it is anything to do with the pool itself.

The remaining bombs will spawn on someone in melee range, the spread debuffs will fall off, then we stack, repeat, rotating up the side of the room slowly.

<Callout type="warning">

Melee should not spread around Flarendo in the middle part of the room. A bomb spawned centrally like this is much more annoying as the fight goes on. Even as pictured in the RaidPlan, the topright most melee in the image would place an annoying bomb. It's not the end of the world, try to avoid being as close to the middle of the room as humanly possible.

</Callout>

### Torq Side

There are no positioning requirements for Torq's side on Heroic. I don't recommend stacking on heroic because the [Thunderdrum Salvo][thunderdrum-salvo] is *more* dangerous if the group is only stacked within, for example, a Healing Rain sized circle instead of being pixel stacked. The people in the middle could be completely surrounded with nowhere safe to run. Until there's a reason for space management, e.g. Mythic, I would just spread out. As for the mechanics, I make these recommendations:

- You *must* get in the habit of stutter-stepping the [Thunderdrum Salvo][thunderdrum-salvo] to avoid getting stunned. I don't know the timing of when the swirls explode, but there will likely be a WeakAura with markers in it to indicate this.
- If you get a [Voltaic Image][voltaic-image] on you and you can't keep it crowd-controlled yourself, you should take it into the boss so melee can keep it locked down. You'll just get yourself stunned and killed trying to just natty outrun it, only for the image drops a shame puddle on your Kentucky-fried corpse.

<Callout type="info">
  ðŸ¤“ðŸ‘† The Torq side will likely do a similar movement pattern to Flarendo on Mythic because the [images][voltaic-image] leave behind their [miasma][lingering-electricity] when they disperse, even if they don't hit anyone.
