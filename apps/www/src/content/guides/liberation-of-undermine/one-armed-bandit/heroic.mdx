## Mechanics

<Mechanic.Root id="461060" name="Spin To Win!" caption="Predestined Slots">

The One-Armed Bandit spins its reels, summoning three "[Reel Assistants](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=234211/reel-assistant)" each with one of 4 unique symbols above their heads representing a Shock Token, Flame Token, Bomb Token, or Coin Token. Killing the attendants drops their token which can be picked up by walking over it.

These coined-up players can then deposit their tokens using their Extra Action Button to form one of the 6 unique possible combinations and win a fabulous prize. Attempting to greedily hold onto the coins and not forming a combination, or repeating a combination, means it will choose for us via [Fraud Detected!][fraud-detected], giving itself 500% increased damage.

- [Reward: Shock and Flame][reward:shock-and-flame] creates a "Superheated Coil" that creates slow-moving [Traveling Flames][traveling-flames] that deal large damage and knock players back.
- [Reward: Shock and Bomb][reward:shock-and-bomb] creates a "Dynamite-Laden Coil" that summons 5 small "Dynamite Booty" adds, chasing a random player with [Explosive Gaze][explosive-gaze] that deals large damage and applies a dot to the entire raid if they reach their target.
- [Reward: Flame and Coin][reward:flame-and-coin] causes the One-Armed Bandit to rapidly apply a stacking dot on the raid, dealing heavy rot damage.
- [Reward: Coin and Shock][reward:coin-and-shock] creates a "Premium Currency Coil" that attracts the gold in players bags, pulling them towards the coil, inflicting physical damage.
- [Reward: Coin and Bomb][reward:coin-and-bomb] summons a larger, "Premium Dynamite Booty" that fixate a player with [Explosive Gaze][explosive-gaze], dealing raid damage if they reach their target.
