Vexie rides the Geargrinder, a tank with protective shielding that builds energy to wipe the raid in fiery shrapnel. We can kill biker adds and launch their bikes at the boss to remove layers of the protective shielding. Once all of the shielding is removed the Geargrinder breaks down, entering a vulnerable phase while Vexie and her pit crew to effect repairs before the fight restarts.

## Mechanics

### Phase One

<Mechanic id="466615" env="ptr-2" name="Protective Shielding" caption="Face-Framing Layers">

The Geargrinder remains active while it has any stacks of Protective Shielding. At the start of each active phase, the Geargrinder applies 6 stacks of this buff to itself.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="471403" env="ptr-2" name="Unrelenting CAR-nage" caption="100 Energy Enrage" pill={[<MechanicPill key="1" variant="red">Enrage</MechanicPill>]}>

If the Geargrinder reaches 100 energy it will enrage, dealing 1.2 million fire damage to the raid every 2 seconds and applying a stacking 755k fire damage every 1 sec for 8 seconds, stacking. This can be interrupted by removing any remaining protective shielding.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="459943" env="ptr-2" name="Call Bikers" caption="Sons of Anarchy">

The Geargrinder periodically summons three [Geargrinder Bikers](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=237516/geargrinder-biker) that cast [Hot Wheels][hot-wheels], charging across the platform at a random player dealing 5.6 million fire damage to anyone hit and knocking them back.

If they charge through an [Oil Slick][oil-slick] they will be stunned for 5 seconds, otherwise they will charge through their targeted player's location and into the arena wall, stunning them momentarily before picking a new target.

When a Geargrinder Biker is killed players can interact with the bike to enter a vehicle UI. The bike can be angled but not moved, and the player has a singular button, [Blaze of Glory][blaze-of-glory], which launches the bike at the Geargrinder, dealing 1.2m fire damage to the raid and applying 100 energy to the Geargrinder.

<Callout type="warning">

You only have 20 seconds in the vehicle.

</Callout>

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="459453" name="Blaze of Glory" caption="Bike Boss Kamikaze">

When a biker is killed they leave their bike behind, allowing players to interact with them to angle the launch the bike at the Geargrinder, causing the Geargrinder to suffer 1% of its max health in damage and losing 1 stack of [Protective Shielding][protective-shielding]. This also causes a burst of raid damage and rains down [Burning Shrapnel][burning-shrapnel] for the raid to dodge.

<Callout type="error">

The bikes can be left alone until the intermission, at which point they despawn. However, once a player gets in a bike they only have 20 seconds to launch it at the Geargrinder. Similarly, leaving the bike or the firing it through an [Oil Slick][oil-slick] will also destroy it.

</Callout>

The Geargrinder launches oil at targeted players after 5 seconds, dousing players within 12 yards of their location with a mild dot for 12 seconds and leaving behind an [Oil Slick][oil-slick]. The miasma causes a slip-and-slide effect making stopping and starting or changing direction difficult.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="468207" env="ptr-2" name="Incendiary Fire" caption="Fireball Bombardment" pill={[<MechanicPill key="1" variant="purple">Private Aura</MechanicPill>]}>

Several players are fixated for a bombardment of fire at their current location for 6 seconds, launching every 0.5 sec. Each swirl deals 1.8 million fire damage and burns away any [Oil Slick][oil-slick] it hits.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="459627" env="ptr-2" name="Tank Buster" caption="Name Unclear" pill={[<MechanicPill key="1" variant="blue">Tanks</MechanicPill>]}>

The Geargrinder slams its current target for 9.4 million physical damage, knocking them back and applying a 503k bleed for 25 sec. This applies a 200% stacking vulnerability for 25 sec, causes the boss to cast [Exhaust Fumes][exhaust-fumes], and leaves behind an [Oil Slick][oil-slick] on heroic

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="468147" name="Exhaust Fumes" caption="Hot-Boxed Raiders" pill={[<MechanicPill key="1" variant="green">Healers</MechanicPill>]}>

The exertion from the [Tank Buster][tank-buster] causes the Geargrinder to release a smog that deals 377k shadow damage to the raid every 1 sec for 6 sec. This ability deals 25% more damaage with every cast.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="459974" env="ptr-2" name="Bomb Voyage!" caption="Periodic DoT on several players" pill={[<MechanicPill key="1" variant="green">Healers</MechanicPill>]}>

Geargrinder bombers debuff several players with bombs, that deals 906k fire damage on application and apply a DoT dealing 629k fire damage every 1.5 sec for 9 sec.

</Mechanic>

### Phase Two

<Mechanic id="460603" env="ptr-2" name="Mechanical Breakdown" caption="Get Menty-B(ent)">

When all stacks of [Protective Shielding][protective-shielding] are removed, the Geargrinder breaks down causing it to take 100% increased damage until Vexie completes a [Tune-Up][tune-up] over 45 seconds, applying new plating.

Simultaneously, [Pit Mechanic](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=228514/pit-mechanic/heroic-encounter-journal) adds will spawn that repeatedly try to channel an interruptible and cc-able cast, [Repair][repair] until killed, hastening repairs by 2% every 2 sec.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="460386" env="ptr-2" name="Backfire" caption="Hot Car Air" >

For the duration of the phase Geargrinder deals 1.5 million fire damage to the raid every 2 seconds.

## Strategy

In heroic a strategy is secondary to whatever helps us kill the boss as fast as possible. There are many different ways of approaching the [Oil Slicks][oil-slick] and choosing to clear them or not with [Incendiary Fire][incendiary-fire].

The only thing we want to avoid is making it impossible for the bikes to hit the boss with [Blaze of Glory][blaze-of-glory]. This comes in two flavors â€” constantly moving the boss around the edge of the arena, leaving a snail trail of oil, or centralizing the boss in some way with the ranged pseudo-stacked by him and getting rid of the oil.

There is a lot of excess movement and an increased need to chase down bikers when the boss isn't centralized, so I'm showing a strategy from the Raid Leader Exchange.
- The tanks move the boss into the middle on pull and then stutter-step into the corner after the boss drops oil from the [Tank Buster][tank-buster]. The raid will want to be stutter-stepping with their back to the corner as well. A better stacked raid means better stacked bikers.
- Players who get [Spew Oil][spew-oil] will want to place them to the sides of the raid. The picture shows the 1st set placed centrally; this is only to let players not move as far and isn't part of the strategy.
- Players [Incendiary Fire][incendiary-fire] want to do their best to clear the oil. In any strategy where the boss isn't moved completely away from the oil we need to clear or it gets in the way of [Blaze of Glory][blaze-of-glory]. The gateway lets players immediately disengage from the group and then sprint back towards the boss, clearing any oil in their path. Or, especially for melee, you can just run straight through the boss towards any old oil. You have to run through oil to clear it anyway.

The only real player responsibility is to remember, "if I get fire I run it into any oil in the middle," and if that's not reasonable then god help us all. Just be careful because there are 2 (?) players who get fire at the same time. 

## Timing Sequence

The timings of when the Bikers cast [Hot Wheels][hot-wheels] are estimations based on when someone got hit by the charge. The Bikers are completely absent from logs.
