## Summary

These are the principle expectations for each raider, expanded upon below. Not meeting these expectations will lower a player's standing in the loot council, and if not corrected, will result in removing the player from the guild.

1. Consistently maximizing rewards from Mythic+ though the weekly vault and the end of dungeon rewards at the beginning of a tier.
2. Uploading droptimizer data to WoWAudit before Sunday nights at midnight or after your gear changes if in the middle of our raid week.
3. Preparing yourself by researching the fights, keeping addons and WeakAuras updated, and being online 15 minutes prior to 8:00 PM CST.
4. Having a 90%+ attendance record and giving ample warning to the officers about any upcoming absences.

## 1. Mythic+

Raiders are expected to be utilizing Mythic+ as a significant portion of their gearing strategy and the council exercises the right to reward players for efforts outside of raid, in addition to punishing players who fail to meet this expectation.

- All raiders are expected to fill their mythic+ vault slots to the highest level possible when the difficulty is reasonable.
- Utilizing Mythic+ for gear and crests is mandatory until such a time that a raider has a set of fully upgraded mythic gear, at which point it is up to their discretion whether they continue to pursue gear fom mythic+.

## 2. Wishlists

- Wishlists must be submitted to our [WoWAudit](https://wowaudit.com/us/illidan/lemonade-stand/wishlists/personal) by Sunday at midnight every week to give officers ample time to act on this data.
- If any item of your raid set changes in any way you are expected to update your wishlist before the above deadline next week.
- You are allowed to request loot with <span className="text-rose-400">outdated</span> wishlist data, meaning your gear set is different in any way from what was used during your droptimizer, if both of the following are true. 
    1. You have <span className="text-rose-400">not</span> changed many pieces of gear. If you upgraded a ring 1 time and changed your boots*, this is fine. This will cause your droptimizer numbers to be slightly different as your stats are different, but this won’t broadly effect that something is, say, a 5k dps upgrade.
    2. You are also <span className="text-rose-400">not</span> requesting loot from the slot(s) which have changed. *If you’ve obtained new boots but haven’t updated your wishlist, all information about the value of boot drops from raid are now highly inaccurate.

- If you violate any of the above conditions your wishlist is considered <span className="text-rose-400">inaccurate</span> and it needs to be updated before the next loot council session or Sunday at midnight, whichever is closer.
- If you need to update your wishlist during raid, you must ask an officer to refresh the WoWAudit data from the desktop application and reload their UI before they start the next loot session.
- Inflating the value of upgrades you are requesting with inaccurate wishlist data through negligence or malice, is a severe violation of other players time, respect, and trust. It will not be tolerated.

## 3. Loot Council

Gear is a tool the officers uphold to distribute in good faith to support the raid to the best of our ability. It is a balance of employing the broad strokes of numerical optimization without being so robotically dogmatic we ignore the merits and abilities of each player and the raid as a whole.

The officers will weigh the immediate and past performance of players, our current progression needs, imbalances in overall raid gearing, class balancing, exemplary preparation by a raider or lack thereof outside of raid, and other factors as deemed necessary in a way that deviates from raw numerical optimization at their discretion.

- The council operates as if they are giving players their 3rd and 4th tier tokens and utilize tier simulations to target the best 4 piece bonuses in our raid, prioritizing DPS tier first. Tanks and healers have a lower tier priority.

- The officers reserve the right to ignore a raider's request for gear if their wishlist data is missing or not conforming to the requirements described in [2. Wishlists](#2-wishlists). We will not stop the raid so you can run a droptimizer, nor will we babysit the wishlist data and notify everyone who needs to update theirs.

- You are expected to include any relevant context in your note when putting in for a dropped item.
    - If an item lets you change your embellishments.
    - If you want an item, but cannot equip it right now for any reason, such as if you need an off-hand to use a main-hand that dropped.
    - If you want to catalyze something, tell us when you would catalyze it. Now? Next week? Only if you don’t get something to catalyze from mythic+?
    - If it’s simply better for your mental, such as going from 2 on-use trinkets to one, or allows you to switch to an easier build.

- Players are expected to hit the <BlockedIcon className="inline text-rose-500 rotate-x-180 size-5" /> pass button if the World of Warcraft Need/Green/Disenchant buttons appear. Pressing anything else can be viewed as an attempt to ninja loot gear.

- Utilizing the RCLootCouncil buttons in a joking manner wastes officer time and is not welcome. If you absolutely have to, the note can be used for humor. However, anything that can be construed as a valid request for gear is similarly unwelcome, e.g. "I need this to play Destruction," could be intended as a joke if, say, Destruction is not viable in raid at the moment, but an officer may not be aware of this, and you'll waste their time earnestly looking over your request.

- If you are playing two specs for a character in the raid, as confirmed by officers, you may use the non-offspec button for both specs. However, you should indicate which spec an item is for.

- BoE’s that drop go to the guild to sell, but a raider can put their name for it to buy at a discounted price.

## 4. Attendance

- An attendance record of at least 90% is required to be considered a main raider.
- Planned absences should be recorded in our <span className="text-emerald-300">#attendance</span> channel as soon as the raider is made aware, with the minimum being 24 hours ahead of time barring emergencies.
    - You may message officers or use your trial thread if the reasoning for your absence is private, but you are required to make sure the officer confirms your planned absence is recorded in attendance.
- Not showing up to raid 15 minutes prior to our 8:00 PM CST start time is considered late.

## 5. Raid Preparedness

- All raiders are expected to perform their own research on raids. Theoretical mastery is not required, but complete ignorance will be held against you.
- All raiders are required to review any informational materials on the raid, such as official RaidPlans or strategies, and ask questions if necessary.
- All raiders are expected to arrive 15 minutes ahead of raid start time (7:45 CST) so we may form, kill trash, and get any administrative tasks out of the way.
- We require one split character to be ready at the beginning of each tier. These characters do not need to be maintained after the conclusion of our split runs.
- Raiders are required to properly gem, enchant, belt buckle, …etc, their gear. One-time consumables such as these are not provided by the guild but can be requested from our guild crafters.
- All raiders are expected to be comfortable with sitting for current progression needs. As part of preparedness, raiders are expected to be available if sitting unless told otherwise. We will post the roster ahead of time for upcoming raid nights no later than 2 hours before pull time.
    - Due to this general understanding, players who are sat will not be notified of the reasons why unless explicitly asked.
- All other expectations and policies on this page all fall under the general umbrella of raid preparedness.

## 6. Communication

- We are an adult guild and players should be comfortable with adult language.
- We do not tolerate any racial epithets.
- We do not tolerate anything said with the intent to maliciously demean or hurt others.
- The officers do not have extrasensory perception — all raiders must be communicative about their concerns in order for us to resolve them.
    
       
    
    > Something that is a major problem to you may not have the same importance to someone else. If you have a problem you need remedied it needs to be conveyed to the officers. We often have to juggle many different problems of varying intensity, so unless you convey to us how serious something is to you, we may not prioritize (or even know) about it.
    
    In the situation that the officers cannot help with your problem, we will have at least come to an understanding of where each party stands instead of letting the problem fester. Feel welcome to always open lines of communication with the officers, even if your feelings are negative or just a means of venting.
